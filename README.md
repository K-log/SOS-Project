Nauy and Noah's SOS Project
----

We will be making a 2D topdown game in Unity.

This is our project's weekly journal.

### Week 1

  *Plan for the week:*
  Create a project outline for what we want to do with our project. Install Unity and learn how to use the tools that are    provided in it to start on our project

  Nauy: Create the player movement animations which include include walking and attacking Left/Right/Back/Front.

  Noah: Create the Player movement Script and learn how to control animation from the script. 
  
  *Issues we have run into:*
  - [ ] Controlling the player animation changes from the script and within the animation controller. 
  - [ ] Creating a Tilemap/game map. This depends on if/what external software we use apart from unity and where we're at as far as art assets.
