Nauy and Noah's SOS Project
----

We will be making a 2D topdown game in Unity.

This is our project's weekly journal.

### Week 1
  Create a project outline for what we want do to with our project install Unity and learn how to use tools that provide in the Unity to start on our project

  Nauy: Animate the player movement animations characters include walking and attking Left/Right/Back/Front

  Noah: working on Player movement Script and learn how to connect animation to the player script 
  
  Frist problem we stuck with is how to connect the player movement animation with each other and set them to link with the anystate for the script later without using the Entry that just can link and automatic run for testing 
  
  Learned to create background and figure a way to add movement to the player allow it to move up down left right
  next step gonna be try to connect movement and animation of the player and limit the movement in a specifit way to fit with the background map
