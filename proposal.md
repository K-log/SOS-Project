## Final Project proposal

2D Game Design

### Abstract:
  The premise of our project is to make a 2D game using Unity2D. To give a basic picture for our vision of the game, it will draw heavily on concepts in Skyrim but be styled closer to Stardew Valley. As neither of us have ever ventured into the area of game development this project will push our abilities in many ways, mostly pushing us to use the knowledge we have gained programming prior to this in new ways. The game’s story will be written entirely by us along with all the games code, and most of the art assets although we may employ the help of a friend as we lack the artistic abilities, tools, and time to create all the art assets as this is first and foremost a programming project.

* What you will do
  *	Create a game in 2D with the Unity game engine
  *	Build art assets
  * Design a story
  * Write code 
*	Why this problem is interesting (to you and to the field)
    * This is less of a problem and more of a learning experience
      * Games are and ever growing field of computer science and are used for more than just having fun. 
        * Games can teach valuable skills
        * Games can help convey powerful messages
        * Games are a great and fun way to learn how to how to code a large, complex, multi step project from scratch.
          *	We both want to get better at programming as well as apply our skills so this is a good way to do it
*	How it draws on the computer science skills and concepts that you have studied
     * This project will draw on our skills at networking and security(if we have time to make the game multiplayer)
     * Since games have a lot of moving parts our knowledge from operating systems will help us keep the game running smoothly as games can get very complex and our work with threads and locking is important for understanding how to get the most performance out of our game without wasting resources.
     * I imagine our knowledge gained from data structures will be very important as using it to help represent things to the player as well as storing valuable assets will be important. 
     * It will draw on our creativity and push us to think of new ways of doing things with code that we have not thought of yet.
     *	Game development draws a lot on our geometry experience as many physical things in real life are emulated in a game so being able to interact with game geometry is very important.
* How it will add to your understanding going forward
  * Knowing how to work on a large complex project with other people is very important for programming in the future.
    * Two people working on the same project at the same time without accidentally breaking it or stepping on each other’s toes.
  * Being able to adapt to new coding environments and languages quickly as we both have never tried to code a game, used unity, or used C#.
* A sample schedule that is your best guess as to the steps you will need to complete and what "deliverable" identifies that step's completion.
  * Without actual dates, here’s how we imagine the project schedule will go:
    *	Learn Unity/C# and make one or two simple projects like Pong and a sidescrolling game to familiarize ourselves with the environment(approximately 1-2 weeks).
    *	This is stuff we plan to do over the break so that when winter quarter starts we can go straight into creating the game.
  *	Hash out a more permanent outline for the game and get started on some of the game’s intro
    *	Mainly get a feel for how long it’ll take us to complete the whole game and allow us to divide up what we want to work on based on time of completion.
  *	Create the basic art assets and continue with level development
    *	It will be easier to figure out how much time it will take once we have figured out how long it will take to make a level, the mechanics for it, and the assets
  *	Middle weeks are just for content and asset creation
    *	Expand on the size of the game
    *	Every week double check time line to make sure we are on track
  *	Skip ahead a few weeks to the end chunk of the game:
    *	Play testing
    *	Adding/Removing features
    * Bug fixing
    *	Potential porting to a touch based environment like IOS or Android( if we have time )
*	A bibliography of the background research that you completed and will reference going forward.
    * Unity3D.com has a lot of learning resources and great documentation:
      *	https://unity3d.com/learn
      *	https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html
    *	We are using https://www.sololearn.com/ to learn C#
    *	The book Unity 4.x Game Development by Example Beginner's Guide By Ryan Henson Creighton
