### Week 1
  Nauy: Create the player movement animations which include include walking Left/Right/Back/Front.

  Noah: Create the Player movement Script and learn how to control animation from the script. 
  
  *Things we have completed:*
  Create the player movement animation and Player movement Script that allow us to control the Player on keyboard
  
  *Issues we have run into:*
  - [x] Controlling the player animation changes from the script and within the animation controller. 
  - [x] Creating a Tilemap/game map. This depends on if/what external software we use apart from unity and where we're at as far as art assets.  

### Week 2
  Nauy: player movement animations which include include attacking Left/Right/Back/Front.

  Noah: Create the Player movement and attacking Script.
  
  *Things we have completed:*
  Controlling the player animation with moving and attacking connect with working script.
  
  *Issues we have run into:*
  - [x] The animation working with the moveement and attacking but it still has some delay time when switching between each animation.
  
### Week 3
   Noah: Add title screen	display script to make the title screen the same size regardless of the screen size.		
   
   Nauy: Add title screen	Write script to make the title screen link with other StartGame/Howtoplay/Quit/Credits/Backtomenu
   
   
   *Things we have completed:*
  - Successfully link all screens in the main menu with each other.
  - Transitioned to 2D sidescroller format. This will allow us to focus more on gameplay elements and less on having to draw assets.
  
  
  *Issues we have run into:*
  - [x] The player follow camera is not as precise as we would like and needs some minor adjustments.
  - [ ] We need to clean up our project working directory and start moving away from doing all our testing in the working directory as we begin to add more perminent elements to the base game components.
  

### Week 4
  Noah: Added movement; Walking left and right and jumping. Made the player follow camera faster.
    
  Nauy: Added Completed start screen and started basic UI setup. Fixed a bug in the player follow camera.
    
  *Things we have completed:*
    - Successfully completed player walking left and right and player jumping.
    - Successfully completed the menu and start screen.
    
  *Issues we have run into:*
  - [ ] We broke the animation system while getting the movement to work so that needs to be fixed.
  - [ ] Wall and double jumping still needs to be fixed. Currently wall jumping semi works but it still has a ways to go.
  - [ ] We need to optimize the code to make it more responsive.
