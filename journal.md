### Week 1

  *Plan for the week:*
  Create a project outline for what we want to do with our project. Install Unity and learn how to use the tools that are    provided in it to start on our project

  Noah: Create the Player movement Script and learn how to control animation from the script. 
  *Thing we have completed:*
  Create the player movement animation and Player movement Script that allow us to control the Player on keyboard
  
  *Issues we have run into:*
