The basic idea for our timeline is to spend the first half of the project work creating and testing components and features to go in our game. Then the second half we will take those features and implement them into our finished game.
Each item in this schedule is planned to be started the week it is shown and if all goes to plan, finished by the end of that week. If a feature can not be finished by the end of the week then we will continue working on it until it is a usable state BEFORE starting on the next weeks features.

# Winter

Week 1
----
Setup how we want the game to work, look, and feel on paper.
  * How we want the player to move.
  * How we want the combat to feel.
  * What kind of features we want in the game.
Design a basic story for at least the beginning/first level of the game.

Week 2
----
Get started on the movement system.
  * Make the movement animations.
  * Our game will be an RPG so combat and movement will be a big focus of what we are creating.
  * Because of this we will get to work on these features first as getting them right may take the longest amount of time.
  * Add wall and double jumping.
  * Special movement abilities like dashing, dodging, crouching etc.

Week 3
----
Get started on the combat system.
  * Make the combat combat animations.
  * Make the combat feel responsive and get the weapon collision working
  * Add basic enemies to test with(Just sprites that can be hit and provide debug info)

Week 4
----
Finish the started combat and movement systems.
  * Get both the combat and movement systems fully running so we can move on to game content.
Work on camera movement movement. Add a camera style similar to mario where there is a buffer when you get close to the edge of the screen before the camera begins to recenter around you

Week 5
----
Add the UI system for the game.
  * Add health and stamina bars to the player.
    * *Mana bars may be added in the future but we want the base game to be fully running before we add a magic system.*
  * Add a simple inventory system for the player that can hold items and maybe armor.
  * give the enemies health bars.
  

Week 6 
----
Begin adding features to the final game project.
 * Once the combat and movement systems are completed, create a simple first level and add the player.
 * Combine all working features we have so far.

Week 7
----
Create the AI controller for the enemies.
  * Add some simple pathfinding, most likely using an A* algorithm, to the enemies.
  * Give the enemies the ability to attack.
  

Week 8 
----
Add items to the game.
  * Weapons, Poitions, Armor.
    * Add scripting to them to give them more than just cosmettic abilities.

Week 9
----
Swap out the prototype level design for what will hopefully be our level.
  * Add scripting to level components where needed.
      * Make moving objects move, breakable objects break etc.

Week 10
----
Bug testing and play testing.
  * Hopefully we will have time to remove any bugs that come up.
  * We would like to spend the week getting everything feeling right such as difficulty, controls, story with the help of play testers. 
  
# Spring

As week got fairly behind when we thought we would be at this point, there may be some duplicate things in the spring section of the timeline that were not completed in the winter.

Week 1
----
Build the first level.
   * This involves figuring out how the level should flow, what enemies to be added what features should be in it.
   * I also need to create tiles to build the level out of and as I'm not very good at art this could take a while.
    
Week 2
----
Finish the combat system. So far I have a health and mana bar as well as a basic enemy system and movement. The enemy system consists of just have the enemies be drawn to the player with no regard for obstacles in the way.
